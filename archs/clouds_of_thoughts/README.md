# Clouds of Thoughts Model

An implementation of the Clouds of Thoughts neural architecture for multi-step reasoning.

## Setup

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the model directly from the Python script:

```python
python model.py
```

Or import it into your own code:

```python
from model import CloudsOfThoughts

# Initialize model
model = CloudsOfThoughts(
    embedding_dim=64,
    hidden_dim=128,
    knowledge_dim=100,
    reasoning_steps=3
)

# Use with your data
import torch
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)
output = model(input_tensor)
```

## Model Description

The Clouds of Thoughts model implements:

1. Input understanding using linear transformation
2. Knowledge matching using multi-head attention
3. Multi-step reasoning through refinement layers
4. Output generation
